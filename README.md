# Game_of_Tones

For this marketing study, I have created fictional sales data for an imaginary beauty company called "Game of Tones." This company offers a collection of skincare products and color cosmetics inspired by HBO's hit series "Game of Thrones." All customers listed in the raw data are named after "Game of Thrones" characters for educational purposes only.

For example, one customer named Daenerys Targaryen bought Dragon Fire Foundation on January 1, 2019 (20190101). All product sales data is stored in a csv file (GoT_Sales_Stats_Fictional.csv or you can look at GoT_Sales_Stats_Fictional.xlsx). You can open this file using Excel, Google Sheets, or various text editors. Using this data, the GoTones team wants to launch a new marketing strategy: To send one customized complimentary product to each individual customer in its database (instead of blindly sending the same complimentary product to every customer in its database). The GoTones marketing team believes that this strategy will increase client retention.

That being said, the GoTones marketing team plans to use the following sales data to easily and efficiently determine which complimentary product each customer will receive with his or her next online purchase. Each individual customer will be sent a complimentary version of the product that he or she has purchased most frequently year-to-date (YTD). In addition to this customized gift with purchase promotion, the GoTones team wants to leverage the data to discover which product was the highest-performing and which product was the lowest-performing.

This project is my attempt to show ways in which cosmetic companies can leverage data to create individually-targeted, customer-centric marketing campaigns. My goal is for each customer to receive a meaningful, relevant gift with purchase, which, in turn, will increase brand loyalty and customer retention. I also want to show how cosmetic companies can use data to study product performance. 

Please note that I have taken inspiration from HBO's "Game of Thrones" and generated this imaginary data for educational purposes only, not for commercial purposes.
